CANCION #1
I'm thinkin' about, thinkin'about sex
always hungry for something
that i haven't had yet.
Maybe baby you got somethin'to lose
well i have something,
i have somethin' for you

(Chorus)
My way - Your way
Anything goes to night
My way - Your way
Anything goes to night

Panties around your knees
with your ass in debris
Doin' dat grid 
with a push an' squeeze
Tied up, tied down
up against the wall
be my rubbermade
and we can do it all
